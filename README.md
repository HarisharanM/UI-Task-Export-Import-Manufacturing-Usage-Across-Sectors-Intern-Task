# 🌍 Export-Import & Manufacturing Across Sectors

> ✅ **Project Task by: WhiteCircle Group**  
> 🧑‍💻 **Developer:** Harisharan Mishra (Intern)

This is a fully responsive and interactive web interface built as part of an internship assignment for WhiteCircle Group. It visually highlights how export-import and manufacturing play vital roles across 14 major industry sectors. Each sector is presented using a clickable card that opens a detailed image modal to showcase real-world applications.
