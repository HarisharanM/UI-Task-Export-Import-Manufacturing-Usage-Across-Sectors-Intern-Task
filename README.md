## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üîê Secure Login-First Architecture**: The entire site is protected. Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to a dedicated login/signup page.
* **üë§ User Authentication & Session Management**:
    * **Sign Up**: New users can create an account, with their credentials stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
    * **Login**: Registered users can log in. A successful login creates a session flag in `sessionStorage`.
    * **Logout**: The session can be terminated via a "Logout" button, which clears the session flag and redirects the user to the login page.
* **üöÄ Interactive Sector Showcase**: The "Services" page features a dynamic grid of 14 industry sectors.
* **üìã Detailed Modals**: Clicking a sector button opens an informative modal displaying sample import/export products, complete with cloud-hosted images and prices.
* **üì± Fully Responsive UI**: The layout is built with modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid), ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5**: For the structure and semantic content of the web pages.
* **CSS3**: For all styling, including a dynamic gradient background, responsive layouts, and modal animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**: For all client-side logic, including:
    * The authentication "gatekeeper" flow.
    * DOM manipulation for the interactive modals.
    * Handling user events and form submissions.
    * Managing `localStorage` (for user persistence) and `sessionStorage` (for session state).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HarisharanM/UI-Task-Export-Import-Manufacturing-Usage-Across-Sectors-Intern-Task/.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
    ```

3.  **Open the application:**
    Open the **`login.html`** file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). This is the designated starting point for the application.

## üß† Core Logic: The Login Gatekeeper

The security of the site is managed by a simple yet effective "gatekeeper" function at the top of the `script.js` file.

1.  When any page loads, the script immediately checks for an `isLoggedIn` flag in the browser's `sessionStorage`.
2.  If the flag is **not found** and the user is trying to access any page other than `login.html`, the script redirects them to `login.html`.
3.  If the flag **is found**, the script allows the page content to become visible by removing a default `display: none` style from the `<body>`.
4.  This `sessionStorage` flag is only set upon a successful login and is cleared when the user logs out or closes the browser tab, ensuring that each session requires a fresh login.
